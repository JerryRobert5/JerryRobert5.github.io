                <h3>Habitat for Humanity</h3>
                Habitat for Humanity partners with people in your community, and all over the world, to help them build or improve a place they can call home. Habitat homeowners help build their own homes alongside volunteers and pay an affordable mortgage. With your support, Habitat homeowners achieve the strength, stability and independence they need to build a better life for themselves and for their families. Through our 2020 Strategic Plan, Habitat for Humanity will serve more people than ever before through decent and affordable housing..</p>

                <h3>Let There Be Mom</h3>
                <p>Let There Be Mom works to preserve the legacies of moms and dads with life-threatening illnesses. Once a family submits an Application for Services, and it is determined that they meet our criteria (they have children 18 years old or younger, their doctor must sign the “Physician’s Statement”, and they must be able to communicate with us), we will contact the family to set up our initial meeting. During this meeting, we conduct an interview with the parent who has applied for services. This is their time to tell us about themselves and let us know what they would like their children to know about them. From there, we brainstorm on ways to put their talents, hobbies, hopes, and dreams into tangible forms for their children.</p>

                <h3>United Way</h3>
                <p>Through collaboration, innovation, volunteerism and strategic investment, we are achieving results. Because of the community’s generous support of United Way, more of our neighbors have access to basic needs like food, housing and healthcare; more students are graduating high school; and more people are trained and hired for self-sustaining jobs, creating greater economic mobility for individuals and families in Greenville County.</p>
